 <div class="verse"><span class="xl smcap">From</span> high Olympus and the ætherial courts,</div>
 <div class="verse">Where mighty Zeus our angry king confirms</div>
 <div class="verse">The Fates’ decrees and bends the wills of the gods,</div>
 <div class="verse">I come: and on the earth step with glad foot.</div>
 <div class="verse indent2">This variegated ocean-floor of the air,</div>
 <div class="verse">The changeful circle of fair land, that lies</div>
 <div class="verse">Heaven’s dial, sisterly mirror of night and day:</div>
 <div class="verse">The wide o’er-wandered plain, this nether world</div>
 <div class="verse">My truant haunt is, when from jealous eyes</div>
 <div class="verse">I steal, for hither ’tis I steal, and here                          <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
 <div class="verse">Unseen repair my joy: yet not unseen</div>
 <div class="verse">Methinks, nor seen unguessed of him I seek.</div>
 <div class="verse">Rather by swath or furrow, or where the path</div>
 <div class="verse">Is walled with corn I am found, by trellised vine</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
 <div class="verse">Or olive set in banks or orchard trim:</div>
 <div class="verse">I watch all toil and tilth, farm, field and fold,</div>
 <div class="verse">And taste the mortal joy; since not in heaven</div>
 <div class="verse">Among our easeful gods hath facile time</div>
 <div class="verse">A touch so keen, to wake such love of life</div>
 <div class="verse">As stirs the frail and careful being, who here,                     <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
 <div class="verse">The king of sorrows, melancholy man,</div>
 <div class="verse">Bows at his labour, but in heart erect</div>
 <div class="verse">A god stands, nor for any gift of god</div>
 <div class="verse">Would barter his immortal-hearted prime.</div>
 <div class="verse indent2">Could I but win this world from Zeus for mine,</div>
 <div class="verse">With not a god to vex my happy rule,</div>
 <div class="verse">I would inhabit here and leave high heaven:</div>
 <div class="verse">So much I love it and its race of men,</div>
 <div class="verse">Even as he hates them, hates both them, and me</div>
 <div class="verse">For loving what he hates, and would destroy me,</div>
 <div class="verse">Outcast in the scorn of all his cringing crew,</div>
 <div class="verse">For daring but to save what he would slay:</div>
 <div class="verse">And me must first destroy. Thus he denieth</div>
 <div class="verse">My heart’s wish, thus my counsel sets at naught,</div>
 <div class="verse">Which him saved once, when all at stake he stood</div>
 <div class="verse">Uprisen in rebellion to overthrow</div>
 <div class="verse">The elderseated Titans, for I that day</div>
 <div class="verse">Gave him the counsels which his foes despised.</div>
 <div class="verse">Unhappy they, who had still their blissful seats</div>
 <div class="verse">Preserved and their Olympian majesty,                               <span class="linenum">40</span></div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
 <div class="verse">Had they been one with me. Alas, my kin!</div>
 <div class="verse indent2">But he, when he had taken the throne and chained</div>
 <div class="verse">His foes in wasteful Tartarus, said no more</div>
 <div class="verse">Where is Prometheus our wise counsellor?</div>
 <div class="verse">What saith Prometheus? tell us, O Prometheus,</div>
 <div class="verse">What Fate requires! but waxing confident</div>
 <div class="verse">And wanton, as a youth first tasting power,</div>
 <div class="verse">He wrecked the timeless monuments of heaven,</div>
 <div class="verse">The witness of the wisdom of the gods,</div>
 <div class="verse">And making all about him new, beyond                                <span class="linenum">50</span></div>
 <div class="verse">Determined to destroy the race of men,</div>
 <div class="verse">And that create afresh or else have none.</div>
 <div class="verse indent2">Then his vain mind imagined a device,</div>
 <div class="verse">And at his bidding all the opposèd winds</div>
 <div class="verse">Blew, and the scattered clouds and furlèd snows,</div>
 <div class="verse">From every part of heaven together flying,</div>
 <div class="verse">He with brute hands in huge disorder heaped:</div>
 <div class="verse">They with the winds’ weight and his angry breath</div>
 <div class="verse">Were thawed: in cataracts they fell, and earth</div>
 <div class="verse">In darkness deep and whelmèd tempest lay,                           <span class="linenum">60</span></div>
 <div class="verse">Drowned’neath the waters. Yet on the mountain-tops</div>
 <div class="verse">Some few escaped, and some, thus warned by me,</div>
 <div class="verse">Made shift to live in vessels which outrode</div>
 <div class="verse">The season and the fury of the flood.</div>
 <div class="verse">And when his rain was spent and from clear skies</div>
 <div class="verse">Zeus looking down upon the watery world,</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
 <div class="verse">Beheld these few, the remnant of mankind,</div>
 <div class="verse">Who yet stood up and breathed; he next withdrew</div>
 <div class="verse">The seeds of fire, that else had still lain hid</div>
 <div class="verse">In withered branch and the blue flakes of flint                     <span class="linenum">70</span></div>
 <div class="verse">For man to exact and use, but these withdrawn,</div>
 <div class="verse">Man with the brutes degraded would be man</div>
 <div class="verse">No more; and so the tyrant was content.</div>
 <div class="verse indent2">But I, despised again, again upheld</div>
 <div class="verse">The weak, and pitying them sent sweet Hope,</div>
 <div class="verse">Bearer of dreams, enchantress fond and kind,</div>
 <div class="verse">From heaven descending on the unhindered rays</div>
 <div class="verse">Of every star, to cheer with visions fair</div>
 <div class="verse">Their unamending pains. And now this day</div>
 <div class="verse">Behold I come bearing the seal of all                               <span class="linenum">80</span></div>
 <div class="verse">Which Hope had promised: for within this reed</div>
 <div class="verse">A prisoner I bring them stolen from heaven,</div>
 <div class="verse">The flash of mastering fire, and it have borne</div>
 <div class="verse">So swift to earth, that when yon noontide sun</div>
 <div class="verse">Rose from the sea at morning I was by,</div>
 <div class="verse">And unperceived of Hêlios plunged the point</div>
 <div class="verse">I’ the burning axle, and withdrew a tongue</div>
 <div class="verse">Of breathing flame, which lives to leap on earth</div>
 <div class="verse">For man the father of all fire to come.</div>
 <div class="verse indent2">And hither have I brought it even to Argos                        <span class="linenum">90</span></div>
 <div class="verse">Unto king Inachus, him having chosen</div>
 <div class="verse">Above all mortals to receive my gift:</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
 <div class="verse">For he is hopeful, careful, wise, and brave.</div>
 <div class="verse indent2">He first, when first the floods left bare the land,</div>
 <div class="verse">Grew warm with enterprise, and gathered men</div>
 <div class="verse">Together, and disposed their various tasks</div>
 <div class="verse">For common weal combined; for soon were seen</div>
 <div class="verse">The long straight channels dwindling on the plain,</div>
 <div class="verse">Which slow from stagnant pool and wide morass</div>
 <div class="verse">The pestilent waters to the rivers bore:                           <span class="linenum">100</span></div>
 <div class="verse">Then in the ruined dwellings and old tombs</div>
 <div class="verse">He dug, unbedding from the wormèd ooze</div>
 <div class="verse">Vessels and tools of trade and husbandry;</div>
 <div class="verse">Wherewith, all seasonable works restored,</div>
 <div class="verse">Oil made he and wine anew, and taught mankind</div>
 <div class="verse">To live not brutally though without fire,</div>
 <div class="verse">Tending their flocks and herds and weaving wool,</div>
 <div class="verse">Living on fruit and milk and shepherds’ fare,</div>
 <div class="verse">Till time should bring back flame to smithy and hearth,</div>
 <div class="verse">Or Zeus relent. Now at these gates I stand,                        <span class="linenum">110</span></div>
 <div class="verse">At this mid hour, when Inachus comes forth</div>
 <div class="verse">To offer sacrifice unto his foe.</div>
 <div class="verse">For never hath his faithful zeal forborne</div>
 <div class="verse">To pay the power, though hard, that rules the world</div>
 <div class="verse">The smokeless sacrifice; which first today</div>
 <div class="verse">Shall smoke, and rise at heaven in flame to brave</div>
 <div class="verse">The baffled god. See here a servant bears</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>

<h2><a name="NOTES" id="NOTES">NOTES</a></h2>


<h3>NOTE ON EROS AND PSYCHE.</h3>

<p>This Poem is in all essentials a faithful translation
of Apuleius’ story, the chief differences being that
first, in the way of form, I have, for the sake of
balance and contrast, chosen to lengthen the introductory
portion; I have also located the story in
Crete, and this gives rise to occasional description.&mdash;The
description of the sunset on <a href="#Page_83">p. 83</a> is a portrait
of the phenomena which followed the great eruption
of Krakatoa.&mdash;Secondly, in the way of ethic I have
made a gentler characterization of Psyche, who deserves
more care in handling the motives of her conduct
than was perhaps felt in Apuleius’ time and
country.</p>

<p>The acrostic on <a href="#Page_102">p. 102</a> is a remnant of my
original dedication. In the first edition there was
a note acknowledging the frequent translations from
the Greek, and other robberies: and in the second,
in which I altered the spelling, I gave my reasons
for that, in so far as it is unusual. These reasons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
I need not repeat here, especially as the spelling is
not at all as I should wish to see it. I advocate
liberty in these matters instead of the conventional
tyranny. But I will add here that the main inconsistencies
of the punctuation are owing to this
volume being a reprint of three separate books.
The stops are intended solely for the readers’ convenience;
and almost anything is better than the
regulations of a methodic punctuation, which by
assuming the possibility of indicating all the varieties
of grammatical structure and rhythmic pause by four
symbols, cannot be applied without perpetual vexation
and injury.</p>


<h3>NOTE ON THE GROWTH OF LOVE.</h3>

<p>It was not my wish or intention to offer these
sonnets to the public, but since they have been published
in America without my permission, and some
of them have appeared in collections of poetry in this
country, and have been mentioned in professional
criticism, I have thought it wise to come to their
rescue, and include them in this edition of my
poems; to which end I have, while this volume was
in the press, revised them; cutting out ten, and
amending the worst places in others where I could.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
As they now stand they still make an imperfect
poem, but one for which I need not further apologize.</p>

<p><i>Note on Sonnet XIX.</i>&mdash;The octett forms part of my
‘Purcell Commemoration Ode,’ published as No. 2
of Elkin Mathews’ ‘Shilling Garland,’ 1896, and set
to music by Dr. Hubert Parry.</p>

<p><i>XXXV.</i> The argument is partly from Michael
Angelo’s Madrigal xix.</p>

<p><i>LXIII.</i> Partly from the anonymous sonnet No. 3793
in the Libro reale, ‘Io vivo di speranza.’</p>

<p><i>LXIV.</i> The first quatrain from Michael Angelo’s
Madrigal, ‘Beati voi.’</p>

<p><i>LXVII.</i> ‘The sunsets of five years ago,’ which
happen to be described on <a href="#Page_83">p. 83</a> of this volume.</p>

<p class="psig">R. B.</p>

<p class="pdate">1898.</p>

<h3>Transcriber's Notes</h3>

<p>Obvious typographical errors have been silently corrected. Variations
in hyphenation spelling and punctuation remains unchanged.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
